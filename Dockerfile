# relative symlinks with the .pnpm store nested under node_modules, so the
# pruned node_modules copies cleanly into the production stage below.
# --ignore-scripts skips the `prepare` lifecycle (husky), which pnpm runs after
# pruning; husky is a devDependency that prune just removed, so without this the
# step dies on `sh: husky: not found`
